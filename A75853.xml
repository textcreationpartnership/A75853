            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Prinne</hi> this day got in, and he would have it called <hi>Bedlam,</hi> for here is frantick Mr. St. <hi>John,</hi> Hairbrained <hi>Hasilrig,</hi> sensless <hi>Lowry</hi> and <hi>Atkins,</hi> possessed <hi>Vane,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted <hi>Nichols,</hi> and a multitude more of Madmen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides fooles, therefore he thought it fit that the chaines and fetters might be removed from <hi>Newgate</hi> hither, to be Keepers of the liberties, thereupon the House ordered it to be referred to a Committee, and adjorned till the aft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernoon, and that Mr. <hi>Prinne</hi> should come no more there, for he was too wise and too honest to be in that place.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon they met, and upon debate these things were resolved on.</p>
            <list>
               <item>First Resolved, That the Family of the <hi>Cromwell's</hi> were not born <hi>Protector's.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Secondly Resolved, That it's more convenient we should have the Government, we having already the Crown lands, So they adjorned till the next morning.</item>
            </list>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 10th.</p>
            <p>This day it was referred to a Committee to consider of the selfe denying Ordinance, and they are to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:168719:3"/>that there are severall Kings lands yet to be sould, therefore they are to report whether it be convenient that that Ordinance be in force or no.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 11th.</p>
            <p>This day the Committee, whereof St. <hi>John</hi> was chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, reported to the House, that by Law that Ordinance was of no force, for the intent of the Makers of Lawes must be observed, and it cannot be intended, that the Makers thereof would so far prejudice their own interests as to have that Ordinance to be in force when Lands are to be sould, and places to be disposed of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 12.</p>
            <p>Ordered, that this day usually called <hi>Ascension-day,</hi> be no more called so, but henceforth <hi>May</hi> 7th. be called by that name, in commemoration of our ascent to the old shop on that day. And this was the great work of that day.</p>
            <p>From May 13th. to May 20th.</p>
            <p>The House took into their consideration, the titles of honour and dignity conferred by Squire OLIVER, and his Son RICHARD, and also other titles to be given, and thereupon it was enacted as followes.</p>
            <list>
               <head>The Contents of the Act for Names, Titles, and Dignities, &amp;c.</head>
               <item>First enacted, That our fellow member Alderman <hi>Atkins,</hi> be no more called Alderman Tom. Alderman shitbritch, Sir Tom, Sir Alderman, Tom. Thumb, but it all ordinary proceedings he be called and stiled Tom fool, and in exigents, let him be named Tom. Turd.</item>
               <item>Secondly, that <hi>Harry Nevill</hi> be no more called religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Harry Nevill,</hi> that the people may take notice he is one of the Councell of state.</item>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:168719:4"/>
               <item> Thirdly, that the eldest Son of OLIVER Protector have the same addition of title and dignity, that the long Parliament conferred upon the eldest Son of the late King to all intents and purposes.</item>
               <item>Fourthly, That all other titles of honour whatsoever be sequestred, and the profits arising thence to goe to the payment of the late Protectors debts.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Provided that this Act nor any thing herein shall not be construed to take away or null those apt and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable titles that are given to the severall Members and Councell of State, and recorded in the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Book of <hi>Englands Confusion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>May</hi> 20th. to <hi>June</hi> 1.</p>
            <p>This day the regulation of the Law was taken into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration: And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Resolved,</hi> That the ablest Lawyers be prohibited to judge or practise, that the Law may florish and justice be done.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ordered,</hi> That old Collonel <hi>Walton</hi> grow yong again before three weeks, or the dissolution of this Parliament, and by that time become as frollick as he was with the Barbers Wife, that his young Wife may no longer be forced to get a snap abroad, at the great charge of the Publick; And that in the interim he sit close in the House, and that she hath allowed to her an universall tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration during that time and no longer.</p>
            <p>Yesterday the Colt formerly drowned at <hi>Huntington,</hi> and taken up at the great charge and paines of the Mayor and Recorder, was voted a Sturgion, <hi>vemine contradicente,</hi> And it was ordered that Serjeant <hi>Bernard</hi> have the next Sturgion, to his own use, any grant or prescription to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers notwithstanding.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:168719:4"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Resolved.</hi> That Paules-Steeple is the Crosse that stood formerly in Cheap-side, and therefore to be pulled down forthwith.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reported from the Committee of safety as followes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the best way to settle this Nation in peace is to sell the residue of the Lands, &amp;c. And dispose of them amongst the Parliament-men that were not liberally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for before 1653. Yet we conceive that Sir <hi>Arthur Hasilrig</hi> remembred himselfe pretty well before that time, however if the Parliament adjudge 30000 lb <hi>per annum,</hi> not sufficient for him, let him have more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Report was taken into consideration accordingly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of great import.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thereupon the house resolved into a grand Committee to debate the proportioning of the said lands to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular members according to their wants.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lenthall.</hi> Gentlemen can ye think that I, that I your Speaker, your everlasting Speaker, who am resolved to live and dye with you at 5 lb <hi>per diem,</hi> can live to maintain my selfe and family at that great rate I now live at, and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Grandeur that should attend the Speaker to so noble persons, with 13000 lb <hi>per annum,</hi> and not above 80000 lb in personall estate.</p>
            <p>
